APPLICATION FAILED TO START

Description:

The dependencies of some of the beans in the application context form a cycle:

   template
┌─────┐
|  gate_rr_adapter
↑     ↓
|  org.apache.camel.model.rest.springboot.RestConfigurationDefinitionAutoConfiguration (field private org.apache.camel.CamelContext org.apache.camel.model.rest.springboot.RestConfigurationDefinitionAutoConfiguration.camelContext)
└─────┘


Action:

Relying upon circular references is discouraged and they are prohibited by default. Update your application to remove the dependency cycle between beans. As a last resort, it may be possible to break the cycle automatically by setting spring.main.allow-circular-references to true.
